        <p>The code examples and scenarios that appear in the Using Rules
             Extensions section are based on the documents of a fictitious 
             company called Fabrikam. These scenario documents are located 
             on your product CD. By following the scenario documents, you will be able
              to create and use the infrastructure represented in the code examples.
                The ClassicMetadirectory folder contains the files and instructions 
                for creating the infrastructure. The SimpleAccountProvisioning folder 
                contains the files and instructions for using rules extensions.
